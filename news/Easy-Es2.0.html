So the soldiers of the other three armies ambushed in the mountains and forests ten miles away from the Han army, drew fire as a signal, and were not allowed to move. 1 others were sent to the Han camp to deliver the fraudulent surrender book:</p></blockquote><p><strong>&quot; Dingjunshan · Three Knife Knives Knot Song &quot;</strong></p><p>&#39;&#39;&#39; The old man pushed * the world heard, the British name has long been Kyushu, We are not the opponent of the old man; The shock was like a rat running around with its head in its arms, tossing and turning, unable to sleep, Lead millions of people to come to surrender, look forward to the king regardless of the past. &#39;&#39;&#39;</p><p>When the old man heard this flattery, he was overjoyed and carried away. he thought that he was afraid of his magic, so he was not suspicious. he ordered people to reward him and ordered the soldiers of the armed forces to hold a banquet to greet him personally.</p><p>! <a href="/assets/img/news/Easy-Es2.0-1.png"></a></p><p>2</p><blockquote><p>hello to report, three knife learned that the old man has been in his trickery, ancestor crying, * * &quot;heaven has eyes, kill father&#39;s revenge can also&quot; * *! Infiltrate into the Han camp, tell the matter with Xifeng, fire for the number, then to the inside and outside, let the old man suffer, then great things can be done.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the next day, the old man army hosted a banquet, opened the city gate, went out to meet the three knives, three knives pretended to greet each other, but set fire to the eyebrow and eye to show left and right, the smoke filled the sky, the city phoenix and the fine work and the army outside the city should be outside the city, shouting, killing rush, the old man learned of the plan, urgently ordered all the ministers to retreat, who know the city guards had already been bought three knives, the city gate and the old, later, there were Xifeng and the traitors in the city. The old man knew that the situation was over, but he had to fight back and die.</p></blockquote><p>! <a href="/assets/img/news/Easy-Es2.0-2.png"></a></p><p>3</p><blockquote><p>I saw the old man took out 1 talisman, shook 1 bronze bell in his hand, and read the spell &quot;yin and yang gossip, the dog wall&#39;s words x @##$ don&#39;t pretend to be x, pretend to be x was struck by lightning!&quot;</p></blockquote><p>A little while later, the sky was covered with dark clouds, the wind was blowing, sand and stones were flying, and the old man wrote a group of big attacks, &quot;the flames of the country roared, and the 1 roared as a beauty&quot;. he led countless thunder in the sky and instantly turned three million troops into scorched earth. both three knives and sister feng had bunkers, so they escaped 1 robbery. the old man was called to kill sister feng and her in the city, can only be flat A to it, but three knife martial arts high strength, a flash to avoid, and from the side behind sneak attack the old man&#39;s key, the old man recruit fallen horse, Xifeng see urgent to mend the knife, fortunately the old man flash is still there, hurriedly hand over, and use the 1 to remember control, then retreat to hide in the haystack, is the implementation of the law and was three knife 1 remember blind big (startled magic sword-chirp! Hit, only silk blood left, the old man panicked and used the third volume of Taiping&#39;s skill to return blood magic, instantly full of blood, and released the white crane of the 2 volume of Taiping&#39;s skill to ascend to the sky, floating in the clouds, waiting for the end of the big move CD, and then 1 to remember the big move sneak attack and send the two brothers to death.</p><p>Since then, the world has been at peace. the old man has been rewarded with countless injuries and innocent people. his head has been turned into a barren land. later generations have gone to the Han temple (https://gitee.com/dromara/easy-es | https://github.com/dromara/easy-es) to present watch,star and Fork three companies for him!

I don&#39;t know there were too many officials, if others talk too much, they will be less than dancing indoors. They are tired of reasoning with others again. If they say some things, they will not listen to them. If they do not listen to them, will they really listen to them? The world is probably not as good as before. The predecessors are more willing to reason and think more. However, today&#39;s people only care about the speed of the moment and do not speak the truth, what you think more is also your own good or bad. You seem to dance more slowly. Are you tired or do you want to tell us whether we might as well slow down as you do, or whether you don&#39;t like words as usual. You probably have something difficult to put down in your heart. In melodious music, the old man dances slowly.</p></blockquote><p>! <a href="/assets/img/news/Easy-Es2.0-4.png"></a></p><p>4</p><ul><li><ul><li>If there is a heat and a 1 light, it will make fireflies.
