2. After a committer is assigned with an issue, the following work is required:

 - Estimate whether it is a long-term issue. If it is, please label it as pending.
 - Add issue labels, such as bug, enhancement, discussion, etc.
 - Add milestone.

**Notice**

Regardless of whether it is a community issue, there must be an assignee until the issue is resolved.
