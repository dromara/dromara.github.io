### Local Configuration

 * File Name: `hmily.yml`。
 
 * Path： The default path is the `resource` directory of the project, which can be specified by `-Dhmily.conf`, and you can also put the configuration in `user.dir` directory. 
          Priority: `-Dhmily.conf` > `user.dir` > `resource` 
         
 * The specific contents are as follows : Notice setting `hmily.server.configMode` = zookeeper  
  
 * The framework will pull the configuration from your configured `zookeeper`. 

```yaml
hmily:
  server:
    configMode: zookeeper
    appName: 
  #  The following configuration will be read when server.configMode equals zookeeper

remote:
  zookeeper:
    serverList: 127.0.0.1:2181 # your zookeeper service address, multiple addresses are separated by ','
    fileExtension: yml # the format of the configuration of zookeeper(properties or yml)
    path: /hmily/xiaoyu # file path to zookeeper configuration
    update :   # the deaflut is false, it means whether write the local configuration to zookeeper
    updateFileName:  # it is the name of configuration when the property of 'update' is true, and it is under the resource directory and the format is yaml
```

* And you can add the needed configuration of `hmily` under the `path`, the configuration format is as follows(yml):
```yaml

* Notice that the configurations of `repository` are extensions of SPI, you can select one from those modes, which don't have to be configured all.

* `metrics` is optional; If it is not configured，it means you don't enable `metrics`.
