```yml
server:
   port: 8888
   context-path: /admin
spring:
   application:
      name: raincat-admin
   profiles:
     active: db
tx:
  admin :
    userName : admin
    password : admin
  redis:
    hostName: localhost
    port : 6379
    #password:
    cluster : false
      # nodes: 127.0.0.1:70001;127.0.1:7002

```

* Finally, please modify your `index.html`, and run the `main` method in `AdminApplication`,  then visit http://ip:port/admin in the browser, enter the user name and password to log in. 

```html
<!--Modify your ip port in href-->
<a id="serverIpAddress" style="display: none" href="http://192.168.1.132:8888/admin">
