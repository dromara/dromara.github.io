## Explanation

* Sentinel is one of the options that supports flow control and circuit breaking.

* Sentinel supports flow control and circuit breaking functions for gateway.


## Plugin Setting

* In `soul-admin` -->  plugin management --> `sentinel` set to enable.

* If you don't want to use it, please close the plugin in `soul-admin`.


## Plugin Usage

* Introducing the follow supports to the pom.xml file of soul project.

    * `Traffic shaping control behavior`: effect(reject directly/ queue/ slow start up), it do not support flow control by invocation relation. 
    
    * `Type of threshold of flow control`: type of current limit threshold(QPS or Thread Count)ã€‚
        
    * `Whether open circuit breaking(1 or 0)`: whether enable circuit breaking function of `sentinel`.
        
    * `Type of circuit breaker`: circuit breaker strategy, support RT of seconds level/ Error Ratio of seconds level/ Error Count of minutes level strategy.
        
    * `Circuit breaking threshold`: threshold.
