## description

* This doc gives a brief description for uploading and downloading files using soul.

## File Uploading

* The default file size limit is 10M.
* For custom limitation, use`--file.size` with an integer variable. e.g.`--file.size = 30`
* Upload your files just as way you did before

## File Downloading

* Soul supports downloading files in streams. There is no need to change anything.
