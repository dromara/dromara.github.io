## Plugin Detail

* Divide is a plugin for http forward proxy, and all http requests are called by this plugin in load balancing.
* Selectors and rules, please refer to: [selector](../selector-and-rule).
* Http configuration is the real invoked configuration after the gateway matches the traffic; You can set multiple configurations and concrete load balancing weights in the rules.
  * Configuration Detail:
     * The first box: hostName, generally fill in `localhost`, which is temporarily unused.  
     * The second box: http protocol, usually fill in ` http:// ` or ` https:// `, if not, the default is: ` http:// `.
     * The third box: ip and port, where you fill in the ip+port of your real service.
     * The fourth box: load balancing weight.   
  * Ip + Port Detection
     * In soul-admin, there is a scheduled task to scan the configured ip and port. If it is found that the ip and port is offline, it will be removed.
     * It can be configured as follows:

```yaml
soul.upstream.check: true  //Default is ture, if setting false, program will not detect.
soul.upstream.scheduledTime: 10  //Timing detection interval, default 10 seconds.
 ```
