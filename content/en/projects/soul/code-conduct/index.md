## Development Guidelines

- Write codes with heart. Pursue clean, simplified and extremely elegant codes. Agree with concepts in `<Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code>` and `<Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship>`.
- Be familiar with codes already had, to keep consistent with the style and use.
- Highly reusable, no duplicated codes or configurations.
- Delete codes out of use in time.

## Contributor Covenant Submitting of Conduct

- Make sure all the test cases are passed, Make sure `./mvnw clean install` can be compiled and tested successfully.
- Make sure the test coverage rate is not lower than the master branch.
- Make sure to check codes with Checkstyle. codes that violate check rules should have special reasons. Find checkstyle template from `https://github.com/dromara/soul/blob/master/script/soul_checkstyle.xml`, please use checkstyle `8.8` to run the rules.
- Careful consideration for each `pull request`; Small and frequent `pull request` with complete unit function is welcomed.
- Conform to `Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct` below.

## Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

- Use linux line separators.
- Keep indents (including blank lines) consistent with the previous one.
- Keep one blank line after class definition.
- No meaningless blank lines. Please extract private methods to instead of blank lines if too long method body or different logic code fragments.
- Use meaningful class, method and variable names, avoid to use abbreviate.
- Return values are named with `result`; Variables in the loop structure are named with `each`; Replace `each` with `entry` in map.
- Name property files with `Spinal Case`(a variant of `Snake Case` which uses hyphens `-` to separate words).
- Split codes that need to add notes with it into small methods, which are explained with method names.
- Have constants on the left and variable on the right in `=` and `equals` conditional expressions; Have variable on the left and constants on the right in `greater than` and `less than` conditional expressions.
- Beside using same names as input parameters and global fields in assign statement, avoid using `this` modifier.
- Design class as `final` class except abstract class for extend.
- Make nested loop structures a new method.
- Order of members definition and parameters should be consistent during classes and methods.
- Use guard clauses in priority.
- Minimize the access permission for classes and methods.
- Private method should be just next to the method in which it is used; writing private methods should be in the same as the appearance order of private methods.
- No `null` parameters or return values.
- Replace if else return and assign statement with ternary operator in priority.
- Use `LinkedList` in priority. Use `ArrayList` for use index to get element only.
- Use capacity based `Collection` such as `ArrayList`, `HashMap` must indicate initial capacity to avoid recalculate capacity.
- Use English in all the logs and javadoc.
- Include Javadoc, todo and fixme only in the comments.
- Only `public` classes and methods need javadoc, other methods, classes and override methods do not need javadoc.

## Contributor Covenant Unit Test of Conduct

 - Test codes and production codes should follow the same kind of code of conduct.
 - Unit test should follow AIR (Automatic, Independent, Repeatable) principle.
   - Automatic: Unit test should run automatically, not interactively. Check test result manually and `System.out`, `log` are prohibited, use assert to check test results.
   - Independent: Call each other and sequence dependency during unit test cases are prohibited. Every test case should run independent.
   - Repeatable: Unit test case should not dependency external environment, they can run repeatable.
 - Unit test should follow BCDE (Border, Correct, Design, Error) design principle.
   - Border: Border value test, test for loop border, special value and value sequence to get expect result.
   - Correct: Correct value test, test for correct value to get expect result.
   - Design: Design with production codes.
   - Error: Error value test, test for error input, exception to get expect result.
 - Without particular reasons, test cases should be fully covered.
 - Every test case need precised assertion.
 - Environment preparation codes should be separate from test codes.
 - Only those that relate to junit `Assert`, hamcrest `CoreMatchers` and `Mockito` can use static import.
 - For single parameter asserts, `assertTrue`, `assertFalse`, `assertNull` and `assertNotNull` should be used.
 - For multiple parameter asserts, `assertThat` should be used.
 - For accurate asserts, try not to use `not`, `containsString` to make assertions.
 - Actual values of test cases should be named `actualXXX`, expected values `expectedXXX`.
 - Class for test case and `@Test` annotation do not need javadoc.
