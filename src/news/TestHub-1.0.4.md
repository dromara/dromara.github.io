## Introduction

TestHub is the 1 automated testing tool based on process orchestration. was born to solve the complex challenges of test process management and execution in the software development journey. Traditional test tools may be limited to interface-level automation and cannot meet diverse needs. We have introduced unique process orchestration capabilities into our TestHub, making it easy for you to define, manage, and execute test processes. Whether it's testing automation, process scheduling, or other automated tasks, TestHub plug-in architecture can meet your unlimited scaling needs.

## Overall front-end reconstruction

The author came from a back-end background and was barely able to write with the support of various front-end bosses around him, but his aesthetic and front-end abilities were obviously insufficient. The discovery of Chat2db in 2023 led to the discovery of new parkways. This front-end reconstruction is based on the front-end of Chat2db3.1.18 as scaffolding, replacing or transforming the following components, and then adding TestHub personalized functions to realize front-end reconstruction and upgrading.

### Color of Tabs labels

There are three colors of fonts in Tabs: default color, red and green. Different colors identify different content states and are used to prompt whether the page data is consistent with the server-side data. Default color: saved, indicating that the data at the front end is consistent with the data saved at the back end. Red: draft not tracked, Changes to be corresponding to git status committed green: edited draft, Changes not Staged for commit corresponding to git status

## About the treasure chest

* *‚ùìThere are already many developed gadgets on the market. Why do you need a treasure chest?‚ùì* *

Indeed, many of the toolkits on the market are typically web-based, which gives them the advantage of being cross-platform because users can access them on any device with a network connection. However, there are some limitations to this web-based toolkit:

> **Insufficient cross-system support**: Most web toolkits are accessed through a browser, and some functions may require the support of the local operating system. This may result in limited or unavailable functionality on some operating systems.

> **Offline access issues**: Web-based toolboxes usually require a network connection to use. If the user is in an environment without a network connection, these toolkits cannot be used.

> **Performance issues**: Compared with local applications, the web toolbox may be limited by browser performance and network speed, resulting in a poor experience.

Therefore, developing a local toolbox software across systems may have its unique advantages:

> **Localization support**: Local applications can better use the functions of the operating system to provide a richer experience and functional support.

> **Offline access**: Local applications can be used without network connection, which improves user flexibility and convenience.

> **Performance advantages**: Local applications are usually faster and smoother than web-based applications because they can better optimize resource usage.

However, it should be noted that not all users have the ability to access the Internet at all times, especially in some regions or certain environments, where network connections may be unstable or unavailable. Therefore, to ensure wider availability, developers may need to consider providing offline support or localized deployment options to meet the needs of different users. (really wantüî™People, such as the author's industry, need cloud desktop office is completely isolated from the external network. Forget it.üî™People break the law or write it yourself)
