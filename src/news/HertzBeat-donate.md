Joining the Apache Incubator is not the end, it's a whole new beginning for the project. After joining the Apache Incubator, at the community level, HertzBeat will actively practice the Apache approach of "open and collaborative" and continue to build a fair, diverse and inclusive open source community. At the level of open source products, listen to users' voices, improve and optimize product experience, and create a docking open source ecosystem.

You are very welcome to join HertzBeat community. The community accepts any form of contribution. Let's work together to promote the development of open source. We hope that one day HertzBeat can become the 1 world-class open source product like Apache Kafka and Apache Tomcat. The code we contribute is deployed and run in all industries and corners of the world.

## What is HertzBeat

Apache HertzBeat(Incubating) is an easy-to-use and friendly open source real-time monitoring and alarm system. It does not require an Agent, has a high-performance cluster, is compatible with Prometheus, and provides powerful custom monitoring and status page construction capabilities.

### Features

* Set **monitoring alarm notification** as a whole, support for application services, applications, databases, caches, operating systems, big data, middleware, Web servers, cloud native, network, custom and other monitoring threshold alarm notification in one step.

* Easy to use and friendly, no need to' Agent', full 'WEB' page operation, one click of the mouse can monitor the alarm, zero learning cost.

* Configurable protocol specifications such as 'Http, Jmx, Ssh, Snmp, Jdbc, and Prometheus'. You only need to configure the monitoring template 'YML' in the browser to use these protocols to customize the collection of desired indicators. Do you believe that new monitoring types such as 1 'K8s' or 'Docker' can be immediately adapted just by configuration?

* Compatible with the' Prometheus' system ecology and more, only page operations can monitor what 'Prometheus' can monitor.
  
*   High performance, supporting horizontal expansion of multiple collector clusters, supporting multiple isolated network monitoring, and cloud edge collaboration.
    
*  Free alarm threshold rules, 'mail',' discord', 'slack',' telegram', 'DingTalk,' wechat, 'flying book',' short message, 'webhook',' server sauce' and other ways to deliver messages in a timely manner.
   
* Provides powerful status page construction capabilities to easily communicate the real-time status of your products and services to users.
  

> 'HertzBeat' has powerful customization, multi-type support, high performance, easy expansion, and low coupling, hoping to help users quickly build their own monitoring system.
