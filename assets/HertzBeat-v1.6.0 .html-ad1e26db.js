Hibernate -&gt; EclipseLink, this is also one of the few migration practices under JPA ecology.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>at the same time fixed some bugs and optimized some functions, more perfect documents. Welcome everyone to try to use it, put forward valuable opinions and suggestions, and jointly promote the development of HertzBeat.ðŸŽ‰</p></blockquote><p>**Of course, the most important thing is to give the best thanks to the contributors in the community! * *</p><p>Download page: https://hertzbeat.apache.org/docs/download/</p><p>Upgrade Guide: https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2024/06/11/hertzbeat-v1.6.0-update/</p><h2 id="what-is-hertzbeat" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-hertzbeat" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What is HertzBeat?</h2><p>Apache HertzBeat (incubating) is an easy-to-use and friendly open source real-time monitoring and alarm system.
