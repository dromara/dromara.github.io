With the core of &quot;high-quality code and low security vulnerabilities&quot;, it adopts the design concept of the Domain-Driven Model (DDD), is fully based on the open-source technology of the entire Spring ecosystem and the OAuth2.1 protocol, supports the authentication of Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as smart TVs and IoT, meets the requirements of the national third-level security protection, supports the encryption and decryption of national secret digital envelopes at the interface, anti-brushing, high protection against XSS and SQL injection, and a series of security system multi-tenant microservice solutions.</p><h2 id="_1-release-background" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-release-background" aria-hidden="true">#</a> [1] Release background</h2><p><strong>Dante Cloud</strong> has always adhered to the concept of &quot;simplicity, efficiency, inclusiveness and pragmatism&quot;, and has been constructed using various emerging technologies or mainstream technologies in the field of microservices and its surrounding areas. It has continuously worked intensively, refined and refined, and carefully built. The goal is to build a product with &quot;high code quality, low maintenance investment, and strong security protection&quot;, which can help users quickly cross the stages of architectural technology selection and technical research and exploration, and reduce the high maintenance investment caused by potential hidden dangers such as security vulnerabilities, technical debts, and low-quality code in traditional projects. It is expected that, just like the meaning of the project name implies, it will connect the past and the future during the period of industry transformation and assist the informatization construction and transformation of enterprises. In the previous versions, Dante Cloud has always adopted the traditional blocking development method and used the mainstream technologies and components in the industry. Although there are many unique bright spot functions of its own, there is no significant difference from the same type of products in the industry. At the end of 2023, a netizen suggested: <strong>Hope Dante Cloud supports GRPC and WebFlux containers</strong> to widen the performance gap with the same type of open-source frameworks. This suggestion opened up a new train of thought. Therefore, after entering 2024, Dante Cloud has taken the design and development of the reactive version as the focus and strived to integrate some new technologies related to the reactive into the product. After several months of unremitting efforts, it finally lived up to expectations. On the occasion of the third anniversary of open source, a version supporting the integration of &quot;blocking&quot; and &quot;reactive&quot; was released.</p><h2 id="_2-new-version-features" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-new-version-features" aria-hidden="true">#</a> [2] New version features</h2><ul><li><p>&#39;Spring Boot&#39; has been upgraded to 3.3.0</p></li><li><p>&#39;Spring Authorization Server&#39; has been upgraded to 1.3.0</p></li><li><p>Java 21 is fully adopted, and virtual threads are turned on by default to improve the processing of blocking operations and reduce the consumption of system resources.</p></li><li><p>Support traditional &#39;blocking&#39; microservices and &#39;Reactor&#39; and &#39;WebFlux&#39; based &#39;Reactor&#39; microservices running in a system at the same time</p></li><li><p>It is not mandatory to use the &#39;responsive&#39; method for development.

Why not do &quot;pure blood&quot; response</h3><p>Responsive has its advantages, but the use of responsive must not face some practical problems:</p><ul><li><p>To do pure blood response, we must first have ecological guarantee. At present, the acceptance of responsive is not very high, and many components do not support responsive. Unless you have the energy to rewrite 1 all the unsupported components used, it is difficult to achieve pure blood, especially for microservice systems.</p></li><li><p>The vast majority of applications need to use databases. Orm components existing in Java either do not support responsiveness (such as JPA), do not support particularly well (such as Hibernate), or need to write too much content (such as R2DBC). Therefore, it is not &quot;cost-effective&quot; to do responsiveness at the data level from the perspective of input-output ratio&quot;</p></li></ul><p>Therefore, it is still necessary to look at the type of application system, and there is no need to achieve pure blood &#39;responsive&#39; when the conditions are not met &#39;.</p><h3 id="_2-what-are-the-benefits-of-being-responsive" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-what-are-the-benefits-of-being-responsive" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2. What are the benefits of being responsive?</h3><p>There are a lot of articles on the Internet about the benefits of &#39;responsive&#39; to &#39;blocking&#39;, so I won&#39;t go into details. For the obvious advantages in practical application:</p><ul><li><p>&#39;Responsive&#39; has higher utilization efficiency of resources. For functions with high resource consumption, the advantages of &#39;Responsive&#39; are more prominent</p></li><li><p>Microservice systems often need to integrate more content, especially at the data level. There may be simultaneous use of multiple types of data storage and data flow and migration. regular event-driven and responsive &quot;flow&quot; thinking is more suitable than traditional blocking.</p></li><li><p>Responsive can work better with event-driven. Event-driven is heavily used in many aspects of the Spring ecosystem, and the core design idea of responsiveness is the same as event-driven.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>Because Dante Cloud uses a lot of Spring Integration content, the traditional blocking method becomes more and more awkward, and it becomes more and more necessary to do responsive support. If you have time to take a good look at Spring Integration, maybe it will open a new world for you.</p></blockquote><h3 id="_3-what-are-the-difficulties-in-learning-responsive-programming" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-what-are-the-difficulties-in-learning-responsive-programming" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3.
