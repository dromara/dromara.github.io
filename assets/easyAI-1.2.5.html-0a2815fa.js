First of all, * * it can be introduced into our Java project by Maven with one click without any additional environment configuration and dependency, so it can be used out of the box. **Furthermore, it not only has some modules for image target detection and artificial intelligence customer service that we have already packaged, but also provides a variety of deep learning, machine learning, reinforcement learning, heuristic learning, matrix operations, and other underlying algorithm tools. Through simple learning, developers can complete the in-depth development of small and micro models that meet their own business according to their own business.</p><ul><li><p>EasyAI Code Cloud Download Links:https://gitee.com/dromara/easyAi</p></li><li><p>EasyAI Technical Document Address：https://www.myeasyai.cn/</p></li><li><p>EasyAI detailed video tutorial：https://www.bilibili.com/video/av89134035</p></li><li><p>EasyAI Framework 0 Basic Deep Development and Artificial Intelligence Complete System Tutorial：https://www.bilibili.com/cheese/play/ss17600</p></li></ul><h1 id="v1-2-5-update-content" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#v1-2-5-update-content" aria-hidden="true">#</a> v1.2.5 Update content</h1><ul><li><p>Optimized for image stability and robustness, improved performance</p></li><li><p>&#39;YoloConfig&#39; is a configuration class for target detection.

The larger the step size, the more suitable it is for the case where the number of training objects in the sample photo is less and more sparse.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>&#39;private double checkStepReduce&#39; is the moving step size of the window during detection, which is based on the shrinkage factor of the window size, and the value range is (0,1].

NOT_RZ&#39; when there is no regular mode, no regular mode that is not to impose a penalty on the weight, when facing some specified shape, image size are relatively fixed industrial products, or when the sample data is large enough, you can directly use the no regular mode.</p><p>When the value is set to &#39;RZ. L1&#39; is the L1 regular mode, and L1 is very robust when there are outliers or unseen abnormal noise. It enhances its stability and robustness by simplifying the model and highlighting the key weights. There is a more useful expression when faced with variable shapes and fewer types of objects to be detected, such as faces, humans, animals and plants.</p><p>When the value is set to &#39;RZ. L2&#39;, for the L2 regular mode, it is easier to mobilize all parameter features, so that the average of the features fall on each weight, the error is most likely to fall to the position of the optimal solution. The best optimization results can be obtained in the face of variable shapes and complex types, or large dimensions.</p></blockquote><p>&#39;private double regular&#39; regular coefficient, the value range is [0,1), when the value is 0, there is no regular influence. adjusting to the appropriate regular coefficient helps to resist overfitting and enhance the robustness and stability of the network. the larger the value, the stronger the penalty for neuron weight, recommend the default value is 0.01</p></blockquote><ul><li>Face detection effect demonstration</li></ul><figure><img src="'+t+'" alt="" tabindex="0"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3 id="image-recognition-fastyolo-effect-display" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#image-recognition-fastyolo-effect-display" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Image recognition FastYolo effect display</h3><ul><li>Using EasyAi to Realize Visual Kernel of Image Settlement Vending Machine</li></ul><figure><img src="'+i+'" alt="" tabindex="0"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3 id="sayorder-artificial-intelligence-customer-service" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sayorder-artificial-intelligence-customer-service" aria-hidden="true">#</a> sayOrder artificial intelligence customer service</h3><ul><li><p>sayOrder is an artificial intelligence customer service system that relies on EasyAi for encapsulation.</p></li><li><p>It can analyze the semantics of user input to identify user behavior, and distinguish user intent ID through typeID.
