First of all, * * it can be introduced into our Java project by Maven with one click without any additional environment configuration and dependency, so it can be used out of the box. **Furthermore, it not only has some modules for image target detection and artificial intelligence customer service that we have already packaged, but also provides a variety of deep learning, machine learning, reinforcement learning, heuristic learning, matrix operations, and other underlying algorithm tools. Through simple learning, developers can complete the in-depth development of small and micro models that meet their own business according to their own business.</p><ul><li><p>EasyAI Code Cloud Download Links:https://gitee.com/dromara/easyAi</p></li><li><p>EasyAI Technical Document Address：https://www.myeasyai.cn/</p></li><li><p>EasyAI detailed video tutorial：https://www.bilibili.com/video/av89134035</p></li><li><p>EasyAI Framework 0 Basic Deep Development and Artificial Intelligence Complete System Tutorial：https://www.bilibili.com/cheese/play/ss17600</p></li></ul><h1 id="v1-2-5-update-content" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#v1-2-5-update-content"><span>v1.2.5 Update content</span></a></h1><ul><li><p>Optimized for image stability and robustness, improved performance</p></li><li><p>&#39;YoloConfig&#39; is a configuration class for target detection.

L1&#39; is the L1 regular mode, and L1 is very robust when there are outliers or unseen abnormal noise. It enhances its stability and robustness by simplifying the model and highlighting the key weights.

L2&#39;, for the L2 regular mode, it is easier to mobilize all parameter features, so that the average of the features fall on each weight, the error is most likely to fall to the position of the optimal solution.
