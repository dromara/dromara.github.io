Suddenly I couldn&#39;t hear what he was saying. My tears couldn&#39;t stop falling. My mind was full of that comment, that comment that made me break the defense.</p><p>I think of when I was at school, I was thrown the test paper on the ground in public, called my father&#39;s name frivolously, and called all kinds of interesting nicknames they thought they were. I was robbed of the tap just because I refuted the 1 sentence and threatened to hit me. He was called a &quot;silly dog&quot;. The data cable that was bought for 5 yuan was cut off. I was surrounded by 1 group of people in bed at night, teaching me to say something wrong in qq group, let me apologize.</p><p>That night, the 1 group of people, a face, I can see, can&#39;t see, are disgusting.</p><p>I remember how embarrassed I was at the time.</p><p>I remembered that after everyone went to sleep, I used to walk alone on the playground, biting my teeth and keeping tears.

But these things have caused me great psychological trauma for a long time.</p><p>I used to think of many ways to get back at them. I also had childish fantasies that I would one day become Superman and have superpowers to torture them.</p><p>But after today, I don&#39;t want to do this anymore. I didn&#39;t forgive them.
