In order to ensure that this event can bring a 1 new technology feast for developers and data professionals, we sincerely invite all kinds of topics and share content. Welcome to show your innovative ideas and practical experience on this platform to jointly promote the development of Flink ecology!</p><p>Flink Forward Asia (hereinafter referred to as FFA) is an official technical conference of the Apache Flink community authorized by Apache to gather leading industry practices and technology trends. With the support of many partners and the assistance of technical developers, FFA has successfully held six sessions. The topics of this summit were carefully selected by the professional selection committee, covering many popular directions such as * * streaming lake warehouse, streaming batch integration, AI big model, production practice, core technology, industry solutions, data integration, cloud native. At the same time, the conference will also focus on high-quality projects hatched by the Flink community, such as Apache Paimon and Flink CDC, to present the latest technology development and application results in the field of real-time computing.</p><p>This is not only an excellent opportunity to learn about the latest developments and development plans of the Flink community, but also an important platform for sharing production experience and exchanging technical achievements with front-line manufacturers at home and abroad. Whether you are a developer or a practitioner in the field of data, do not miss this gathering of industry elites!</p><h2 id="topic-collection" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#topic-collection" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Topic collection</h2><p>Continuing the FFA practice, all topics of this summit are open solicited and screened by a professional topic selection committee to ensure that the content represents the leading level of the industry, to output better quality dry goods for developers, and to provide practical experience for enterprises to learn from.</p><p>**Select up to 3 labels per issue. The main labels are divided as follows: * *</p><ul><li>**Stream Lake Warehouse * *</li></ul><p>With the development of many real-time technologies, the data architecture has gradually evolved from the stream-batch split Lambda architecture to a real-time lake warehouse architecture with stream-batch integration, storage and calculation separation, and lake warehouse fusion, helping businesses obtain more real-time data to drive business decisions.</p><ul><li>**Flow batch integration * *</li></ul><p>Focus on the flow batch integration architecture in the business scenario of the practice cases and benefits, in the landing flow batch integration process of the pain points and thinking. You can also share the technical challenges and technical solutions at the forefront of the stream-batch integrated architecture, including stream-batch integrated storage, stream-batch integrated ETL, stream-batch integrated computing and other technologies.</p><ul><li><strong>Data AI</strong></li></ul><p>Focus on the cutting-edge integration of real-time big data processing and artificial intelligence, and jointly explore how to use Flink to facilitate real-time data upgrading of AI big models, covering but not limited to feature engineering, model reasoning and unstructured data processing, as well as innovative applications of real-time AI big models in various industries.</p><ul><li>**Production Practice * *</li></ul><p>Focus on sharing the pain points, experiences and best practices of using and deploying Flink in production, and jointly discuss how to implement the real-time data processing framework more efficiently, safely and quickly in the real environment.</p><ul><li>**Core Technology * *</li></ul><p>Focus on the core technologies of Flink, such as state management, fault tolerance mechanism, data transmission, large-scale scheduling and core algorithms. As well as the challenges faced in the actual production environment, how to scale and improve through best practices, etc.</p><ul><li>**Industry Solutions * *</li></ul><p>Explore Apache Flink&#39;s real-time data-driven decision-making and analysis solutions in key industry scenarios, analyze technical challenges, share business results, and promote the innovation and development of real-time data processing technologies through these cases.</p><ul><li>**Data Integration * *</li></ul><p>Focus on the value and development of real-time technology in data integration scenarios, discuss how real-time technology improves the timeliness of data processing, analyze how to design a real-time data integration framework based on Flink, and the best practices of real-time data integration technology in different business areas.</p><ul><li>**Cloud Native * *</li></ul><p>Focus on the combination of Flink and cloud native technologies, and explore how to efficiently deploy and deeply optimize Flink stream batch tasks in a cloud native environment. Through practical experience sharing, help developers use containerization, K8s, Serverless and other tools to achieve a balance between stability, performance, and cost.</p><h3 id="issue-delivery-method" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#issue-delivery-method" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Issue Delivery Method</h3><hr><h3 id="pc-https-flink-forward-org-cn" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pc-https-flink-forward-org-cn" aria-hidden="true">#</a> **PC：**<strong>https://flink-forward.org.cn/</strong></h3><h3 id="open-the-official-website-of-ffa-2024-and-click-submit-issue-」" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#open-the-official-website-of-ffa-2024-and-click-submit-issue-」" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Open the official website of FFA 2024 and click **** &quot;Submit Issue 」 * * * *</h3><figure><img src="'+t+'" alt="" tabindex="0"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3 id="mobile-end" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#mobile-end" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Mobile end:</h3><h3 id="scan-the-qr-code-below-or-click-read-the-original-text-at-the-end-of-the-text-」" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scan-the-qr-code-below-or-click-read-the-original-text-at-the-end-of-the-text-」" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scan the QR code below or click &quot;Read the original text&quot; at the end of the text 」 * *</h3><figure><img src="'+i+'" alt="" tabindex="0"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Flink Forward Asia is one of the largest open source top-level project technology summits in China.
