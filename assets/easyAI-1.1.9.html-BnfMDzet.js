First of all, * * it can be introduced into our Java project by Maven with one click without any additional environment configuration and dependency, so it can be used out of the box. **Furthermore, it not only has some modules for image target detection and artificial intelligence customer service that we have already packaged, but also provides a variety of deep learning, machine learning, reinforcement learning, heuristic learning, matrix operations, and other underlying algorithm tools. Through simple learning, developers can complete the in-depth development of small and micro models that meet their own business according to their own business.</p><ul><li><p>EasyAI Code Cloud Download Link: https://gitee.com/dromara/easyAi</p></li><li><p>EasyAI GitHub download link: https://github.com/lifejwang11/easyAi</p></li><li><p>EasyAI main technical document address: https://yhk.yhktech.com/easyai</p></li><li><p>EasyAI detailed video tutorial: https://www.bilibili.com/video/av89134035</p></li><li><p>JAVA Artificial Intelligence 0 Basic System Course: https://www.bilibili.com/cheese/play/ss17600</p></li></ul><h3 id="v1-1-9-update-content" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#v1-1-9-update-content"><span>v1.1.9 Update Content</span></a></h3><ul><li><p>The stability of image target detection is increased, and adjustable parameters are added to balance performance and stability.</p></li><li><p>Complete the functions of the image recognition API, enhance the performance, optimize the engineering and algorithm links of YOLO, simplify the API steps, and make the call clear and simple.</p></li></ul><h3 id="image-recognition-fastyolo-effect-display" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#image-recognition-fastyolo-effect-display"><span>Image recognition FastYolo effect display</span></a></h3><ul><li>Using EasyAi to realize the visual kernel of image settlement vending machine</li></ul><p><img src="'+a+'" alt=""></p><h3 id="sayorder-artificial-intelligence-customer-service" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sayorder-artificial-intelligence-customer-service"><span>sayOrder artificial intelligence customer service</span></a></h3><ul><li><p>sayOrder is an artificial intelligence customer service system that relies on EasyAi for encapsulation.</p></li><li><p>It can analyze the semantics of user input to identify user behavior, and distinguish user intent ID through typeID.
