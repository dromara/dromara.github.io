If you want to publish the commodity module, all other modules will not be able to work at this time.</p></li><li><p>If a certain module interface requires a lot of requests (multiple deployments are required), and another module does not need it, how can you split it?</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Some people may say I can disassemble them into a few web projects. But this will bring new troubles, where to do load balance? Where to do unified certification?</p></li><li><p>Soul gateway solves all the above problems very well, just register your microservice to Soul gateway. You can do whatever you want. For example, the order module has 2 nodes, and you want to release a new version, you can send request to one of them in the gateway, and update the version in the other node. When the update complete, let the request go though both two nodes.
