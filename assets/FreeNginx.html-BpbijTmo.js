However, we have reached an agreement that I will continue to participate as a volunteer in nginx development. In the past two years, I have been working on improving nginx and providing better nginx for everyone for free. Unfortunately, some of F5&#39;s new non-technical executives recently decided to interfere with the security policies used by nginx for years, ignoring both policy and developer positions.</p><p>It&#39;s easy to understand: they own the project and can do anything with it, including market-oriented behavior that ignores the positions of developers and the community. However, this still contradicts our agreement. More importantly, I can no longer control changes to nginx within F5 and no longer view nginx as a free and open source project developed and maintained for the public good.</p><p>Therefore, as of today, I will no longer be involved in nginx development run by F5. Instead, I&#39;ll start another project, run by a developer rather than a corporate entity.</p><p>The goal is to make nginx development unaffected by arbitrary company actions. Help and contributions are welcome. I hope everyone can benefit from it.</p><h2 id="short-statement-on-freenginx-org" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#short-statement-on-freenginx-org"><span>Short statement on freenginx.org</span></a></h2><p>The goal of freenginx.org is to make nginx development independent of arbitrary corporate actions.</p><blockquote><blockquote></blockquote><p>! <a href="/assets/img/news/FreeNginx-1.png"></a></p></blockquote><h2 id="open-source-and-commercial" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#open-source-and-commercial"><span>Open Source and Commercial</span></a></h2><p>Different interests and goals determine the different development directions of open source projects, which is not good or bad.</p><blockquote><p>as a commercial company, F5, after all, spent so much money on nginx and paid the cost of full-time personnel. this definitely needs to be considered in the direction of commercialization, hoping to find a balance between commerce and open source.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Maxim Dounin has a free ideal garden for developers. looking at the development of open source projects from the perspective of developers, nginx can be more open and free, and the direction is controlled by the community.
