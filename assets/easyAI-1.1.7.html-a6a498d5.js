The pursuit of light and fast, small and beautiful, out of the box, so that the majority of small and medium-sized enterprises can easily deploy embedded AI modules for their own system services at low cost.</p><ul><li><p>easyAI download link: https://gitee.com/dromara/easyAi</p></li><li><p>easyAI main API details document: https://wlhlwl.com/gw/easyAi.html</p></li><li><p>easyAI detailed video tutorial: https://www.bilibili.com/video/av89134035</p></li></ul><h3 id="v1-1-7-update-content" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#v1-1-7-update-content" aria-hidden="true">#</a> v1.1.7 Update Content</h3><ul><li><p>The performance optimization of the user semantic decision model that supports the application service &quot;SayOrder&quot; has been greatly improved, and the training speed has been increased by 50 times!</p></li><li><p>The chat stability of the user question and answer model that supports the application service &quot;SayOrder&quot; is improved!</p></li><li><p>remove redundant code, and add elu,relu6,selu and other activation functions, and several matrix bias derivative apis.</p></li><li><p>&quot;SayOrder&quot; is the 1 system based on easyAI engine, which can chat with users independently and intelligently, capture users&#39; needs, complete users&#39; answering questions and guiding consumption, and can freely embed and serve the developer&#39;s internal system platform, and achieve the highest cost performance.</p></li></ul><h3 id="demonstration-of-the-basic-process-of-sayorder-self-generated-orders-and-customer-service-q-a" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#demonstration-of-the-basic-process-of-sayorder-self-generated-orders-and-customer-service-q-a" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Demonstration of the basic process of SayOrder self-generated orders and customer service Q &amp; A</h3><ul><li><p>The first time users make an input to express their ideas! <a href="/assets/img/news/easyAI-1.1.7-1.png"></a></p></li><li><p>SayOrder it is found that the user&#39;s description lacks the necessary information for the order, it will be asked.
