Maybe your field is called <code>msg</code>, which will cause a different structure and bring confusion to the front-end processing. We have noticed this thing: https://github.com/Dromara/soul/issues/109, now it has been optimized, users can customize the return results to define, the specifics depend on the Soul document.</p><h3 id="what-scenarios-of-soul-gateway-are-suitable-and-what-should-you-pay-attention-to" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-scenarios-of-soul-gateway-are-suitable-and-what-should-you-pay-attention-to" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What scenarios of Soul gateway are suitable, and what should you pay attention to?</h3><p>First of all, I think we should follow pragmatism, when you need to use it , then you have monmentum to know it.

If you want to publish the commodity module, all other modules will not be able to work at this time.</p></li><li><p>If a certain module interface requires a lot of requests (multiple deployments are required), and another module does not need it, how can you split it?</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Some people may say I can disassemble them into a few web projects. But this will bring new troubles, where to do load balance? Where to do unified certification?</p></li><li><p>Soul gateway solves all the above problems very well, just register your microservice to Soul gateway. You can do whatever you want. For example, the order module has 2 nodes, and you want to release a new version, you can send request to one of them in the gateway, and update the version in the other node. When the update complete, let the request go though both two nodes. So Java programmer can also do the jod of system operation engineer.</p></li><li><p>If you need unified authentication, you only need to add an authentication plug-in suitable for your business to the gateway.</p></li></ul><figure><img src="'+t+'" alt="soul-admin" tabindex="0"><figcaption>soul-admin</figcaption></figure><h3 id="scenario2-company-entrance-gateway-open-platform" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scenario2-company-entrance-gateway-open-platform" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scenario2: Company entrance gateway (open platform)</h3><ul><li><p>If a company wants to do open-platform or an entrance gateway， authentication, rate limiting, circuit breaker, monitoring are indispensable.</p></li><li><p>If your company is in Dubbo system, when developers have written the Dubbo service, there is no need to add a new web project to provide an interface.</p></li><li><p>If an interface attacked by a large amount of request, how do you deal with it?</p></li><li><p>Soul is here to solve the trouble above, this is the purpose of the design.
