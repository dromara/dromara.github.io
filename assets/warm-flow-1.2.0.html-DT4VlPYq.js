The warm-flow self-developed the flow chart drawing, obtained the coordinates through the designer, and carried out the progress and status of the drawing process (of course, the business system can not integrate the designer, but can design the export xml in the demo project provided by the author, and the business system can be imported again).</p><p><img src="`+n+'" alt=""></p><h2 id="demo-address" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#demo-address"><span>Demo Address</span></a></h2><ul><li>admin/admin123</li></ul><p>Demo Address：http://www.hhzai.top</p><h2 id="official-website" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#official-website"><span>official website</span></a></h2><p>http://warm-flow.cn</p><p>About Dromara</p><p>Dromara is an open source community composed of top domestic open source project authors.
