Version 2.11.3 mainly fixes some bugs raised in the community.</p><p>Version 2.11.3 includes 1 enhancement and 5 fixes in total.</p><p>For the SQL plugin, which is probably the most widely used LiteFlow plugin, we have added a new configuration mapping for &quot;enable&quot; in the new version. This allows you to enable or disable certain flows and scripts in the database. For specific documentation, please refer to the chapter on the SQL plugin.</p><p>At the same time, we have fixed numerous bugs that were left over from the features introduced in versions 2.11.0 and 2.11.1.</p><p>We recommend that users of the 2.11.X series update to this version. The update process is smooth and fully compatible.</p><p>We are making rapid progress with every version, thanks to LiteFlow&#39;s powerful open-source team and our passion for the open-source cause. We develop each feature carefully, pay attention to each test case, enthusiastically answer every question in the community, sincerely listen to everyone&#39;s suggestions, and make every effort to fix every bug.</p><p>If you would like to join us, please contact me.</p><p>It&#39;s that time of year again, the annual Double 11 (November 11th) is here.
