As well as before and after the development of different considerations, the system of various concepts, over-design, naming is not uniform everywhere, reading the source code and secondary development has created a great obstacle. After discussing with the community exchange group and the ideas determined in the design of the multi-merchant version, it was decided to slim down the single-merchant version, focus on the needs of small and micro merchants and developers, and as a verification outpost for the multi-merchant version, carry out a major system restructuring to better cope with the subsequent evolution.</p></blockquote><h3 id="order-concept-simplification" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#order-concept-simplification" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Order concept simplification</h3><ul><li><p>Remove the concept of channel payment orders, there is no longer a multi-level order, from one-to-many to one-to -1</p></li><li><p>Remove the concept of channel refund, only associated with payment orders, no longer associated with channel payment orders, refund orders also return to a 1 relationship</p></li><li><p>Payment and refund-related callback records, closing records, synchronization records, etc., the association relationship is simplified to one-to-many, and there is no longer a many-to-many relationship.</p></li><li><p>Optimize the rules for generating various transaction numbers, and change the original snowflake ID to a number with specific business meaning.</p></li></ul><h3 id="simplified-payment-process" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#simplified-payment-process" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Simplified payment process</h3><ul><li><p>Remove the concept of combined payment, sacrifice 5% of the applicable scenarios in exchange for a 50% reduction in business complexity and a 30% reduction in code volume</p></li><li><p>Simplify the length of payment links and the number of branches, remove some overused design patterns, and make the code easier to start</p></li><li><p>Payment synchronization, callback and refund synchronization, callback removal of special processing logic caused by combined payment</p></li><li><p>Message notification sending process transformation, no longer using complex inheritance combination relationship, only retain the first-class inheritance relationship</p></li><li><p>Callback notification processing no longer uses the inheritance mode, but is modified to the combination mode to improve the convenience of reading and debugging.</p></li></ul><h3 id="reconciliation-process-optimization" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#reconciliation-process-optimization" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Reconciliation process optimization</h3><ul><li><p>Simplify the original obscure process, abstract bit statements and reconciliation differences.</p></li><li><p>Save the original reconciliation file downloaded from the three-party payment institution and provide download function</p></li><li><p>Support downloading system transaction bills and reconciliation variance details to perform offline reconciliation</p></li></ul><h3 id="split-automation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#split-automation" aria-hidden="true">#</a> split automation</h3><ul><li><p>Supports automatic account splitting based on the completed order of the default account splitting team payment.</p></li><li><p>supports automatic synchronization of reconciliation results and automatic completion of split bills</p></li></ul><h3 id="unified-api-interface-style" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#unified-api-interface-style" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Unified API interface style</h3><ul><li><p>Unified parameter naming rules, including the attributes of related parameters such as payment, refund, reconciliation, and account splitting, to achieve a unified style.</p></li><li><p>Unified public request parameters and response parameters, and response parameter format for unified processing</p></li><li><p>The response parameters are signed by default to avoid loss of funds due to tampering by middlemen.</p></li><li><p>Initially unify the exception return format, and subsequently unify all kinds of exception codes and exception information.</p></li></ul><h3 id="front-end-interaction-optimization" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#front-end-interaction-optimization" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Front-end interaction optimization</h3><ul><li><p>Optimize 85% payment-related pages and unify page interaction logic</p></li><li><p>Adapt to various query conditions and displays, and initially complete the functional completeness of the management terminal.</p></li><li><p>Unify the amount of money and use yuan as the display unit.
