How is it possible to have a chicken with a small dish.</p><p>But my heart is unwilling: yes, it is me, why not? What if.</p><p>This sentence gave me great motivation and kept me going until today.</p><p>Three years ago, Leng Zong&#39;s unintentional 1 reply indirectly predicted today&#39;s Sa-Token summit.</p><p>When I pressed f5 to refresh the webpage, Sa-Token replaced pig and rose to No. 1 on the list.</p><p>At this moment, I actually have mixed feelings inside.</p><p>Please allow me to be melodramatic.</p><p>I think of the well-known frameworks/open source projects I used and learned about when I first started working: Hutool, MyBatis-Plus, RuoYi, Layui, OneBlog, JFinal, FastJson, Dubbo......</p><p>At that time, I studied hard to use them and read their source code.</p><p>I remembered my teacher once told me: &quot;Don&#39;t delete your small encapsulated framework, it will be useful to find a job in the future.&quot;</p><p>I think of one of my bosses, who sat next to me when I was working overtime until 12 o&#39;clock in the evening and pointed to Sa-Token official website and said, &quot;believe it or not, you will definitely rely on this for dinner in the future.&quot;</p><p>I think of some negative voices Sa-Token received along the way, some are criticism, some are suggestions, some are satirical, and some are verbal abuse, including attacks on myself and my family.</p><p>I remembered that night, my friend and I were walking in the street. Suddenly I couldn&#39;t hear what he was saying. My tears couldn&#39;t stop falling. My mind was full of that comment, that comment that made me break the defense.</p><p>I think of when I was at school, I was thrown the test paper on the ground in public, called my father&#39;s name frivolously, and called all kinds of interesting nicknames they thought they were. I was robbed of the tap just because I refuted the 1 sentence and threatened to hit me. He was called a &quot;silly dog&quot;. The data cable that was bought for 5 yuan was cut off. I was surrounded by 1 group of people in bed at night, teaching me to say something wrong in qq group, let me apologize.</p><p>That night, the 1 group of people, a face, I can see, can&#39;t see, are disgusting.</p><p>I remember how embarrassed I was at the time.</p><p>I remembered that after everyone went to sleep, I used to walk alone on the playground, biting my teeth and keeping tears. Not crying was the last stubbornness I could do at that time.</p><p>These things are insignificant and not worth mentioning compared to those who have truly experienced &#39;campus violence&#39;. But these things have caused me great psychological trauma for a long time.</p><p>I used to think of many ways to get back at them. I also had childish fantasies that I would one day become Superman and have superpowers to torture them.</p><p>But after today, I don&#39;t want to do this anymore. I didn&#39;t forgive them. I just want to forget them.</p><p>Because I really want to understand what I want in this life, what kind of person I want to be, what kind of things I should do.</p><p>I &#39;ve spent a lot of time thinking about what open source means:</p><p>The significance of open source lies in the openness of the means of production, so that those at the top of the world cannot easily monopolize all means of production.</p><p>In this world, some people can earn a lot of money as long as they lie in bed and sleep every day.</p><p>Others need to work hard in a small house day after day to earn a little money.</p><p>Some people&#39;s descendants can drive luxury cars every day and travel around the world for fun.</p><p>The descendants of some people can only stay in a small county for a lifetime, or even can&#39;t get out of their own town for decades.</p><p>We stay in the same blue sky, breathing the same air, looking at the same stars.</p><p>But some people, born is the protagonist, some people, born is cattle and horses.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if this plot is reasonable. Who is the director behind the scenes, I don&#39;t want to delve.</p><p>I just want to contribute my 1 strength, disclose more means of production, so that more proletarians have the strength and opportunity to try more possibilities, and have more time to truly enjoy the world.</p><p>I want everyone to be the protagonist of this world.</p><p>(Is the pattern a bit too big, then smaller)</p><p>I &#39;ve spent a lot of time thinking about why I&#39;m involved in open source:</p><p>Throw away the superficial ones: bringing better job opportunities, meeting more bosses, or occasionally some reward income.</p><p>I think the bottom is: creation.</p><p>Writing code is a creative process, especially the open source framework. Every line of code needs to be carefully polished, just like creating 1 perfect artwork, drawing, composing and writing novels.</p><p>Constantly upgrade and iterate on the 1 thing to make it perfect. This is the 1 state of flow, 1 a sense of creative satisfaction, just like Hemingway made &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;, Nolan made &quot;Interstellar&quot;.</p><p>When the 1 piece of exquisite art is born, as the author, there will be a kind of proud psychology.</p><p>I will continue because:</p><p>I am a-a writer.</p><hr><p>Attached:</p><p>At this moment, my computer is playing the 1 lyrics:</p><p>The heart of the free world,</p><p>So clear and lofty.</p><p>Blooming and never dying--</p><p>Blue Lotus--</p>',56)]))}const c=n(p,[["render",m],["__file","Sa-Token.html.vue"]]),u=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/blog/Sa-Token.html","title":"Commemoration:1541Days, Sa-Token Top 1 of Gitee Recommendation List","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Commemoration:1541Days, Sa-Token Top 1 of Gitee Recommendation List","author":"click33","date":"2024-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","tag":[null],"cover":"/assets/img/blog/Sa-Token-0.png","head":[["meta",{"name":"Blog"}],["link",{"rel":"alternate","hreflang":"zh-cn","href":"https://vuepress-theme-hope-docs-demo.netlify.app/zh/blog/Sa-Token.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://vuepress-theme-hope-docs-demo.netlify.app/blog/Sa-Token.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Commemoration:1541Days, Sa-Token Top 1 of Gitee Recommendation List"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"2020-02-05: Submit the first version of the code. 2024-04-25: A total of 42.9k star was harvested.
