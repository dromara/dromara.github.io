At present, it mainly provides support for flexible transactions, including TCC, TAC (in which, it will automatically generate rollback SQL) schemes, and XA and more schemes will be supported in the future.
Features High reliability : It supports abnormal transaction rollback and transaction overtime abnormal recovery to prevent transaction suspension in distributed scenarios.
Ease of use : It provides zero penetration Spring-Boot and Spring-Namespace schemes to integrate with business systems quickly.</description></item><item><title>Dubbo Quick Start</title><link>/en/projects/hmily/quick-start-dubbo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/projects/hmily/quick-start-dubbo/</guid><description>Prerequisites JDK 1.8+ Maven 3.2.x Git Zookeeper Cloning the GitHub Repository and Quick Installation &amp;gt; git clone https://github.com/dromara/hmily.git &amp;gt; cd hmily &amp;gt; mvn -DskipTests clean install -U Executing SQL(s) in Demo Module sql

TAC Mode is only suitable for Relational Database.
TAC Mode will intercept the user&amp;rsquo;s SQL statement to generate reverse rollback SQL, and the compatibility of SQL will also be a ordeal.</description></item><item><title>Hmily-code-conduct</title><link>/en/projects/hmily/code-conduct/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/projects/hmily/code-conduct/</guid><description>Development Guidelines Intentions Write codes with heart.
